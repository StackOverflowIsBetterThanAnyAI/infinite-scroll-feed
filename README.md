# Infinite Scroll Feed

This web page was created using fake API data from JSONPlaceholder and UI structures from shadcn.

It resembles a landing page consisting of four differently designed zones, three of which processes data from this respective API.

For faster data access, the data is stored in SessionStorage after initial loading to reduce waiting times when reloading.

The highlight of this page is the infinite scroll feed, which automatically loads and displays new posts when the end of the page is reached by scrolling. The API provides a total of 500 posts. After that, the end of the page is reached.
